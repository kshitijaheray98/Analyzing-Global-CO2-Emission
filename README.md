# Analyzing-Global-CO2-Emission

Objective -

Since the recent years, climate change has become increasingly alarming. The impact of it seems to be an serious issue for both humans and animals. As a result, the analysis in this report is regarding the Co2 emission per country.

Our analysis is developed from variables including country, year, co2, population, GDP, fossil fuel consumption, country size, agriculture production and life expectancy. We obtained the main dataset from Our World in Data website. This dataset includes attributes like country name, year, total Co2 emission, GDP, population and other greenhouse gases.

Since the country size and Fossil Fuel data were not present in the dataset, we scraped it from here and here respectively.

We get the agriculture data for 30 different types of crops from here and combined them together to get the total amount of production each year per country. Later we combined another dataset, Life Expectancy from The World Bank website to get all the potential data which we need to answer our research questions.
